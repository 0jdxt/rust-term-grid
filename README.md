# rust-term-grid [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ogham/rust-term-grid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ogham/rust-term-grid)

This is a library for formatting strings in a grid layout, for a terminal - or anywhere that uses a fixed-width font.

## Installation

It uses [Cargo](http://crates.io/), Rust's package manager. You can
depend on this library by adding `term_grid` to your Cargo dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
term_grid = "*"
```

Or, to use the Git repo directly:

```toml
[dependencies.term_grid]
git = "https://github.com/ogham/rust-term-grid.git"
```
